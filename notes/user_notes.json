    "I'm so disappointed that my clinic is doing poorly. After moving out from Mumbai, I thought I would have continued my practices, but alas! I love serving the people, but people just don't seem to drop by since the fees are too high.",
    "Today I visited a temple and discovered a volunteer-run orphanage nearby. They offer free food and education to underprivileged children.",
    "I want to explore building an education startup focused on hands-on learning."
